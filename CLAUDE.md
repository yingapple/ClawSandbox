# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

ClawSandbox — a minimal, easy-to-use virtualized sandbox tool for OpenClaw. Solves the problem of rapidly deploying multiple isolated OpenClaw instances on a single machine, enabling users to run an entire OpenClaw fleet. Open-sourced on GitHub.

## Build/Test/Lint Commands

```bash
# Download dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build CLI binary → bin/clawsandbox
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Build Docker image (first time, ~1.4GB, takes several minutes)
make docker-build
# or via the CLI itself (uses embedded Dockerfile):
./bin/clawsandbox build

# Cross-compile for all platforms
make build-all
```

## Architecture

Go CLI tool (cobra) that manages Docker containers with an embedded Web Dashboard. Key packages:

- `cmd/clawsandbox/` — binary entry point
- `internal/cli/` — cobra commands (build, create, list, start, stop, restart, destroy, desktop, logs, dashboard, config, version)
- `internal/container/` — Docker SDK wrappers (client, image build/check/pull, network, container lifecycle, stats)
- `internal/port/` — TCP port availability checker and allocator
- `internal/state/` — instance metadata store (`~/.clawsandbox/state.json`), mutex-protected
- `internal/config/` — config file loader (`~/.clawsandbox/config.yaml`)
- `internal/assets/` — embedded Docker build context (Dockerfile, supervisord.conf, entrypoint.sh)
- `internal/web/` — Web Dashboard: HTTP server, REST API handlers, WebSocket endpoints (stats/logs/events), embedded frontend
- `internal/version/` — build version info (injected via ldflags)

Each claw instance is a Docker container running: XFCE4 desktop + TigerVNC + noVNC (browser access on port 690N) + OpenClaw Gateway (port 1878N).

Container data is persisted at `~/.clawsandbox/data/<name>/openclaw/` → `/home/node/.openclaw` inside the container.

## Engineering Principles

All design decisions, project structure, and code implementation must follow best engineering practices. Specifically:

### Security & Least Privilege
- Never use overly permissive settings (e.g. `chmod 0777`) as shortcuts. Solve permission problems by understanding the ownership model and applying minimal necessary access.
- Container processes must run with the correct user for the operation: system management commands (e.g. `supervisorctl`) run as `root`, application commands (e.g. `openclaw`) run as the unprivileged `node` user.
- Never embed secrets or credentials in code, images, or config files.

### Correctness Over Convenience
- Understand the tools you're automating. Read `--help`, check actual behavior, and verify assumptions (e.g. model name formats, plugin enablement, API readiness) before writing integration code.
- Prefer explicit configuration over implicit defaults. If a third-party tool has a default that doesn't suit our use case (e.g. `dmPolicy: "pairing"`), set the desired value explicitly rather than hoping users will figure it out.
- When orchestrating multi-step processes, respect ordering dependencies and readiness checks (e.g. wait for a service to be healthy before issuing commands against it).

### Simplicity & Minimal Surface
- Don't add abstractions, flags, or config options for hypothetical future needs. Solve the current problem directly.
- Prefer calling existing CLI tools (`docker exec` + `openclaw` CLI) over writing config files directly — this keeps the integration resilient to upstream format changes.

## Wiki Documentation

The project wiki lives in a separate repo (`git@github.com:weiyong1024/ClawSandbox.wiki.git`) and is browsable at `https://github.com/weiyong1024/ClawSandbox/wiki`. It is the primary documentation hub beyond the README.

### Wiki structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `_Sidebar.md` | Navigation sidebar shown on every page |
| `_Footer.md` | Footer with repo link |
| `Home.md` | Landing page — value prop, quickstart roadmap, page index |
| `Getting-Started.md` | Prerequisites, install, first instance end-to-end |
| `Dashboard-Guide.md` | Sidebar navigation, asset management, fleet management, image management |
| `CLI-Reference.md` | All CLI commands with descriptions and examples |
| `FAQ.md` | Common issues grouped by install / config / resource / operations |
| `Provider-{Anthropic,OpenAI,Google,DeepSeek}.md` | LLM provider guides (one per provider) |
| `Channel-{Telegram,Discord,Slack,Lark}.md` | Messaging channel guides (one per channel) |

### Content conventions

- **Provider pages** follow a consistent template: Overview → Get API Key (step-by-step) → Add in Dashboard → Assign to Instance → Pricing Notes → Troubleshooting.
- **Channel pages** follow: Overview → Create Bot (step-by-step) → Add in Dashboard → Assign to Instance → Test → Notes → Troubleshooting.
- Key facts to keep consistent across pages:
  - **Models are shared** — multiple instances can use the same model config simultaneously.
  - **Channels are exclusive** — each channel can only be assigned to one instance at a time.
  - **Validation required** — must click "Test" and see validation pass before saving.
  - **Lark is different** — uses App ID + App Secret, not a single token.
  - **Auto-configuration** — ClawSandbox sets DM/group policies to "open" and allows all senders automatically.
- Preset models are defined in `internal/web/static/js/components/model-asset-dialog.js` (`MODEL_PRESETS`). When models change there, update the wiki provider pages and `Dashboard-Guide.md`.
- Validation logic is in `internal/web/validate.go`. If validation endpoints change, update the corresponding channel/provider troubleshooting sections.

### When to update the wiki

**You must update the wiki whenever a code change affects user-facing behavior.** Specifically:

- **New or removed CLI command** → update `CLI-Reference.md`, and `Getting-Started.md` / `FAQ.md` if relevant.
- **New LLM provider** → create `Provider-<Name>.md` using the existing template, add to `_Sidebar.md`, update `Home.md` page index and `Dashboard-Guide.md` preset table.
- **New messaging channel** → create `Channel-<Name>.md` using the existing template, add to `_Sidebar.md`, update `Home.md` page index.
- **Dashboard UI changes** (new sections, renamed labels, changed workflows) → update `Dashboard-Guide.md` and `Getting-Started.md`.
- **Model preset changes** → update `Dashboard-Guide.md` preset table and the relevant `Provider-*.md` page.
- **README wiki links** — both `README.md` and `README.zh-CN.md` have a "Documentation" section linking to wiki pages. Update these links if wiki page names change.

### How to edit the wiki

```bash
git clone git@github.com:weiyong1024/ClawSandbox.wiki.git /tmp/ClawSandbox.wiki
cd /tmp/ClawSandbox.wiki
# Edit files...
git add . && git commit -m "describe the change" && git push
```

The wiki repo uses `master` as its default branch.
